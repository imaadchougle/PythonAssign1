# PythonAssign1
task 1
first we have created num1 and num2 as a user input to use arithemathic operators to create a calculator to do the following tasks like addition ,substraction,etc .
we have a condition if num2 !=0 then division = num1 / num2 ,else division = "Undefined (cannot divide by zero)"

task 2
we have taken user input first name and last  name 
then print a full name inside a print function as a statement Hello, {full_name}! Welcome to the Python program.

#assigment 2
task1
Takes input from the user and converts it to an integer → stored in a.

Checks if the number is divisible by 2 using a % 2 == 0.

If true → it's even.

Else → it's odd.

Prints the result using an f-string


task2

Initialize a variable total_sum to 0.

Loop from 1 to 50 using range(1, 51).

Add each number to total_sum.

Print the final result.
